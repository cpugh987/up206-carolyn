## Introduction
I'm a first year MURP student at UCLA with a background in environmental science. I came to grad school to study climate change and urban design.  

## Course Description and Objectives
This is a GIS and Spatial Data Science course that focuses on visual representations of data to inform urban policy (maps!).  My objectives are to learn the basics of coding using python, be able to create visually appealing maps, and end up with an interesting project that I can use in a portfolio.

## Project Ideas
Project idea 1: looking at LA river's spatial evolution since the 1800s, and how that relates to flooding events. Could also use climate projections (NOAA climate explorer) to create maps of projected rainfall, and try to assess how climate change impacts future risk of LA river flooding events. 

Project idea 2: mapping the flow of water in LA, and identifying opportunties for additional stormwater capture.  Ideas 1 and 2 could use datasets such as LA River Eflows and LA GeoHub. 

Project idea 3: compare projected changes in temperature over time in LA (NOAA Climate Explorer) to projected changes in population growth/urban density (IAM models?) with the aim of identifying areas that might require heat interventions in the future. 

Project idea 4: look at AQI over time in LA as it relates to number of wildfires impacting the area, and look at wildfire projections to try to understand how air quality will be impacted by increasing wildfires.
